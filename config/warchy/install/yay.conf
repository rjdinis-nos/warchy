# Configuration file for yay package management
# yay is an AUR helper built from the AUR repository
#
# [dependencies] section:
#   - TEMP_BUILD_DEPS: Packages needed only for building (removed after build)
#   - BUILD_DEPS: Packages needed permanently (kept after build)
#   - Only installs if not already present
#   - Preserves pre-existing packages (won't remove if already installed)
#
# [version] section:
#   - Command to get installed version (one line output)
#   - For commit-based versions: Extract 7+ character hex hash (e.g., 'ed06abf')
#   - For semantic versions: Extract version number (e.g., '1.2.3')
#   - Without this section, package will always reinstall
#
# Examples:
#   Commit hash: mytool version 2>&1 | grep -oP 'version \K[a-f0-9]+' | head -1
#   Semantic:    mytool --version 2>&1 | grep -oP 'v\K[\d.]+' | head -1
